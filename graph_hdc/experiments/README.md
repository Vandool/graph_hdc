# Computational Experiments

This folder contains all the computational experiment modules. The folder is further structured 
into the following sub-folders:

- ``fingerprints``: Contains the computational experiments related to the usage of the HDC encoder as a 
  viable alternative to molecular fingerprints on molecular graphs.
- ``generation``: Experiments related to graph generation using HDC encoding/decoding and generative 
  models.
